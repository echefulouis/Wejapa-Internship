Additional Practice Resources
When many students are getting started, they often always want more practice. There are a number of great websites you can use for coding exercises and solutions. Two that you should definitely take advantage of are HackerRank and Codewars.

https://www.codewars.com/dashboard

Note: You may find some of the exercises require knowledge on concepts you haven't learned yet. Feel free to google them, or wait until you've gone through all the lessons in this course.

I encourage you to create a profile on both and commit to improving your Python programming skills! As you get better, you can advance to harder problems and sites with even greater challenges. If you spend a lot of time on this, you'll really become a Python programming master.

Happy coding and see you in the next lesson!
